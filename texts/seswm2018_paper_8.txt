Hazard Relation Diagrams: a diagrammatic representation
to increase validation objectivity of requirements-based
hazard mitigations
Bastian Tenbergen1,2, Thorsten Weyer2, Klaus Pohl2

Abstract: This talk is based on a paper published in the Requirements Engineering Journal in May
2017 [TWP17]. During the development of safety-critical systems, the development process must
ensure that requirements, which are defined to mitigate a hazard, are adequate. Adequacy of such
hazard-mitigating requirements (HMRs) means that the requirements may not oppose the system’s
operational purpose and must sufficiently avoid, reduce, or control, the occurrence of the
conditions that trigger the hazard. However, information about the occurrence of the hazard’s
trigger conditions are a work product of hazard analyses during early stages of safety assessment,
while HMRs are a work product of requirements engineering. Dependencies between HMRs and
hazard analysis results are implicit and tacit. In consequence, there’s a risk that during validation,
inadequacy of HMRs regarding their ability to mitigate a hazard remains covert. The result may be
that the system is assumed to be safe, but in fact may still cause injury or death. We introduced
Hazard Relation Diagrams (HRDs) as a means to integrate and graphically visualize hazard
analysis results with HMRs. Herein, we also provide insights into their empirical evaluation and
show that HRDs increase objectivity in rationales containing adequacy judgments.

Principles and Visual Notation of Hazard Relation Diagrams
Hazard Relation Diagrams integrate HMRs with the hazard they are intended to mitigate
in a single diagram [TWP15]. During validation, HRDs is reviewed individually and
sequentially, thereby allowing for alternative mitigations to be validated with regard to
each respective hazard. HMRs are depicted using modeling elements of UML activity
diagrams. HRDs contain exactly one hazard and several mitigation partitions to support
different multiplicities between hazards and HMRs. The dashed mitigation partitions
surround the HMRs and can be distributed across “geometrically” distant areas within
the same or several activity diagrams. HRDs contain the hazard’s tree of trigger
conditions, the conceived safety goal, and one Hazard Relation, which is an n-ary
association relating the hazard, trigger conditions, safety goal, and mitigation partitions.
An example is shown in Fig. 1 (activity labels are removed for legibility).

Empirical Evaluation Shows Increases in Review Objectivity
In two empirical experiments involving a total of 168 graduate and undergraduate
students [TWP17], the hypothesis was investigated whether there is an impact on

objectivity when using HRDs to validate the adequacy of HMRs (treatment condition)
versus using activity diagrams (control condition). Participants were asked to review 10
hazard mitigations and judge if the hazard can still occur during operation and to justify
their judgement in a written rationale. Rationales were categorized into those that
mention “semantics” or “syntax” (i.e., diagram properties also found in activity
diagrams, see also combined variable H1.a), or mention “mitigation,” “trigger
condition,” or “safety goals” (i.e., properties specific to HRDs, see also combined
variable H1.b). Fig. 2 shows the differences between treatment (black bars) and control
(grey bars) conditions. Significant differences bear p-value, effect size, and achieved
statistical power and show that using HRDs, judgments were more often based on
objective information about the hazard, rather than on the diagram’s meaning or style.
